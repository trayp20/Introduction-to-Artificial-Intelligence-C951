# Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-C951 AI and Robotics Project for Career Advising, Disaster Recovery, and Machine Learning Proposal

This project demonstrates capabilities in three areas: chatbot development, robotics for disaster recovery, and a machine learning project proposal. The solutions showcase AI-based interactions, goal-oriented robotic navigation, and a machine learning framework to address a business problem.

# Project Components
# Career Advisor Chatbot:

Built using Pandorabot, this conversational agent helps computer science students explore suitable career paths based on their strengths and interests.

Features: Recommends five computing careers, interacts using AIML-based responses, and provides career insights.

Files: Includes chatbot code, a training approach explanation, and an installation manual for easy access.
# Disaster Recovery Robot Prototype:

Using CoppeliaSim, this robot navigates through a disaster scenario, overcoming obstacles and collecting vital information with added sensors.

Environment: Virtual model with custom obstacles; designed to aid first responders in flood recovery.

Files: Contains robot code, architectural design choices, and a video demo explaining robot behavior, sensor capabilities, and potential for further improvements.

# Machine Learning Project Proposal:
A proposal to use machine learning to address an organizational need, detailing project scope, goals, and expected outcomes.

Features: Identifies relevant algorithms, project methodology, success metrics, data collection strategy, and ethical considerations.

Deliverables: Includes a detailed timeline, resource plan, and criteria for evaluating project success.
